                Clearviction is an open source nonprofit working on a product called the Eligibility Calculator, which

            How do you simplify the complicated legal process of a conviction vacation for a layperson who doesn’t
            understand the jargon?

    </div>

    <!-- the problem -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">The Problem</h3>
        <p>Due to the punitive prison industrial complex in America, many people who have a record can face barriers to
            housing, employment, education, and government assistance, even if they have committed a nonviolent offense.
            However, it is possible for some people to vacate their conviction, which can help them access these
            programs and improve their quality of life.</p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            <strong>
                Unfortunately, the process to determine one’s eligibility can be complicated if one does not know how to
                navigate the legal jargon.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            The goal of this product is to simplify this process by doing the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>Lead users</strong> through a series of questions used to determine if they are eligible for a
                conviction vacation.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct users</strong> to the appropriate resources they need to vacate their convictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage users</strong> by de-mystifying the legal process so they can take back control over
                their lives.</li>

    <!-- user research -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">User Research</h3>
        <p>The <strong>UX Research Team</strong> provided user personas for us to use to get a sense of our users. Based
            on their findings, we were able to determine the following:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>Our users struggle to understand complex legal processes and could get overwhelmed by the documents and
                resources they need to complete a conviction vacation.</li>
            <li>Our users likely come from a low-income background. They may be homeless, mentally ill, or struggling
                with an addiction. They are also more likely to be Black or Latino.</li>
            <li>Our users should come from the state of Washington, which is where the organization is based, but some
                may still try and use our product if their state lacks a similar legal product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            However, I also did my own research regarding our user base specifically for the language guideline and
            discovered the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>The average American reads at a <strong>7th-8th grade level</strong>. Of people who have been
                incarcerated, most cannot read beyond a <strong>4th-grade level</strong>.</li>
            <li>According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy,
                <strong>2/3 of students who cannot read proficiently by the end of the 4th grade</strong>
                will end up in jail or on welfare.
            </li>
            <li>Students who drop out of high school are
                <strong>63% more likely to be incarcerated</strong> than their peers with four-year college degrees.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Having come from an Education background, I was familiar with the school-to-prison pipeline and how
            over-policing could negatively impact our children. This meant that for those who are trying to improve
            their quality of life post-incarceration, there is an additional barrier regarding literacy in addition to
            the existing problem of the already complicated legal process of a conviction vacation.

        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Comparative Analysis</h3>
        <p class="small-spacing-bottom">
            As the lead designer for this project, I completed the research of several different language styleguides,
            with Atlassian and Survey Monkey being the most popular picks that I felt were most relevant to what we
            wanted to do. I received help from other designers and content writers in getting my hands on the AP
            Styleguide and the Washington State Post, which were much more difficult to access.

    </div>
    <div class="small-spacing-top width">
        <p>Based on the research, I decided that we needed to work on the following subcategories:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>Voice and Tone</li>
            <li>Inclusive Language</li>

        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Collaborative Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Because the language styleguide affects everyone in the organization, I wanted to make sure that it
            accommodates everyone. During the process of developing it, I went through the existing research done by
            previous content writers on the stigmatizing language the organization should avoid. Based on that, I
            expanded the language styleguide according to the needs of our product.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Throughout the iterative process, I made sure to keep the UX Research Team, Product Team, and Nemo in the
            loop. The styleguide was looked over by other educators, designers, and content writers to ensure that it
            was relevant to their respective fields and consistent with the values of the organization. I credit my
            partner, who was a project manager with the Marketing Team, for taking the lead in the Social Media portion
            of the styleguide.

            I presented the finalized document to the organization, which at the time had 18 pages total. Not only does
            it standardize the user-facing language in our product, website, and social media, it also standardizes
            the language for the onboarding process for new volunteers.

            <li>
                <strong>Product Team</strong>
                used it for user-facing legal language in the Eligibility Calculator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>UX Research Team</strong>
                benefitted from the research email template that helped them reach out to volunteers who could
                participate in usability tests.

        <p class="text-padding-top">
            <strong>100% of responses have been positive</strong>,
            even for people who did not regularly use language guideline, because it helped them think more critically
            about how we use language and why it was important to be mindful about it.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="text-padding-top">

        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">

                An organization’s website is the first thing a potential user sees when they are looking for solutions

            <p class="text-padding-top">
                Although Clearviction does not collect personal information, because the Eligibility Calculator asks
                sensitive questions about the user's background, it is crucial that the website appears professional,
                reliable, and easy to navigate. To ensure that the website stays relevant, I helped out with the

        <p>The target audience includes older adults, mostly scientists and professors. </p>
        <p>Here are the pain points our team identified based on the user survey and interviews from previous users:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>It's time consuming.</strong> Previous learners report spending more time than anticipated
                watching lectures and working on assignments. </li>
            <li><strong>It's convoluted.</strong> While users have positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the
                material, some have reported difficulty paying attention to the course. </li>
            <li><strong>The product design is dated.</strong> This product relies on traditional classroom-based
                learning styles. These visuals of the course lacks a design system or typography hierarchy, meaning it
                falls behind their competitors' more streamlined online courses.</li>
