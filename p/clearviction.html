            How do you simplify the complicated legal process of a conviction vacation for a layperson who doesn’t

    <!-- the problem -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">The Problem</h3>
        <p>Due to the punitive prison industrial complex in America, many people who have a record can face barriers to
            housing, employment, education, and government assistance, even if they have committed a nonviolent offense.
            However, it is possible for some people to vacate their conviction, which can help them access these
            programs and improve their quality of life.</p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            <strong>
                Unfortunately, the process to determine one’s eligibility can be complicated if one does not know how to
                navigate the legal jargon.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            The goal of this product is to simplify this process by doing the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>Lead users</strong> through a series of questions used to determine if they are eligible for a

            <li><strong>Encourage users</strong> by de-mystifying the legal process so they can take back control over
                their lives.</li>

        <p>
            The <strong>UX Research Team</strong> provided user personas for us regarding our intended audience.
            <!-- Based on their findings, we were able to determine the following: -->
        </p>
        <!-- <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>Our users struggle to understand complex legal processes and could get overwhelmed by the documents and
                resources they need to complete a conviction vacation.</li>
            <li>Our users likely come from a low-income background. They may be homeless, mentally ill, or struggling
                with an addiction. They are also more likely to be Black or Latino.</li>
            <li>Our users should come from the state of Washington, which is where the organization is based, but some
                may still try and use our product if their state lacks a similar legal product.</li>
        </ul> -->
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            However, I also did my own research regarding our user base specifically for the language guideline and
            discovered the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>The average American reads at a <strong>7th-8th grade level</strong>. Of people who have been
                incarcerated, most cannot read beyond a <strong>4th-grade level</strong>.</li>
            <li>According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy,
                <strong>2/3 of students who cannot read proficiently by the end of the 4th grade</strong>
                will end up in jail or on welfare.
            </li>
            <li>Students who drop out of high school are
                <strong>63% more likely to be incarcerated</strong> than their peers with four-year college degrees.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <p class="text-padding-top">
            Having come from an Education background, I was familiar with the school-to-prison pipeline and how
            over-policing could negatively impact our children. For those who are trying to improve
            their quality of life post-incarceration, there is an additional barrier regarding literacy in addition to
            the existing problem of the already complicated legal process of a conviction vacation.

        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Comparative Analysis</h3>
        <p class="small-spacing-bottom">
            As the lead designer for this project, I completed the research of several different language styleguides,
            with Atlassian and Survey Monkey being the most popular picks that I felt were most relevant to what we
            wanted to do. I received help from other designers and content writers in getting my hands on the AP
            Styleguide and the Washington State Post, which were much more difficult to access.

    </div>
    <div class="small-spacing-top width">
        <p>Based on the research, I decided that we needed to work on the following subcategories:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>Voice and Tone</li>
            <li>Inclusive Language</li>

        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Collaborative Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Because the language styleguide affects everyone in the organization, I wanted to make sure that it
            accommodates everyone. During the process of developing it, I went through the existing research done by
            previous content writers on the stigmatizing language the organization should avoid. Based on that, I
            expanded the language styleguide according to the needs of our product.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Throughout the <strong>iterative process</strong>,
            I made sure to keep the UX Research Team, Product Team, and Nemo in the
            loop. The styleguide was looked over by other educators, designers, and content writers to ensure that it
            was relevant to their respective fields and consistent with the values of the organization. I credit my
            partner, who was a project manager with the Marketing Team, for taking the lead in the Social Media portion
            of the styleguide.

    <!-- legal content -->
    <div class="width small-spacing-bottom">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Legal Content</h3>
        <p>
            Because we cannot provide legal advice, we are not allowed to paraphrase or simplify the legal content in
            case we misrepresent it to our users. After brainstorming with my partner, we decided that we could provide
            a glossary or define terms when the users hover their mouse over the text. This way, people who are
            struggling with some of the legal terminology can quickly understand what they are reading.

                An organization’s website is the first thing a potential user sees when they are looking for solutions

                Although Clearviction does not collect personal information, because the Eligibility Calculator asks

                reliable, and easy to navigate. To ensure that the website stays relevant, I helped out with the

        <p>
            Before, the navigation bar was too crowded. Because it was not responsive, the rightmost links would get cut
            off as the window decreased in width. I also noticed that the links on the bottom page did not match the
            links on the navigation bar, and one link redirected to an outdated page no longer in use. We had to notify
            the developers about this inconsistency.

        <p class="text-padding-top">
            To address the problem surrounding the information architecture,
            <strong>I researched several different navigation bars</strong>
            and decided that we should use a double navigation bar - the first row should feature our most important
            components regarding access to our product, while the second row had to do with the website navigation. I
            also reordered the links after going through ideation sessions with the Marketing Team before sending the

            navigation. There was also no exit button, which is an accessibility issue. During the redesign process, I
            corrected both issues and opted to include the top row navigation links as buttons to signify their
            importance to our product.

        <p>
            Because the website was dated, we created a Website Redesign Team to give it a streamlined, modern look that
            would attract users and future partners. Through ideation sessions via group jamboards and digital
            collaboration, we came to the following conclusions:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>The website</strong> used too many dark colors, which made it look heavy and unappealing</li>
            <li><strong>The graphic icons</strong> looked too cartoonish, and should be replaced with images</li>
            <li><strong>The styleguide</strong> needed to be updated according to the website theme, which deals with a
                serious subject matter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- typography -->
    <div class="small-spacing-bottom width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Typography</h3>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            The problem was that the current website used two fonts that looked identical – Inter for body and Sintony
            for headings, both san serif. In my discussion with the designer responsible for the former styleguide, I
            discovered that we wanted to avoid using serif font because it appears official and tied to a government
            entity, which could give the wrong impression to the users.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            I paired several different san serif fonts together, and when presenting it to the Website Redesign Team,
            the favored pairing included Inter for body and Archivo Black for headings.

        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Because there is not much variety in terms of colors, the buttons tend to blend into the website, making it
            difficult for users to identify them. My fellow designer with the styleguide put together a series of color
            palettes that kept to the organization’s theme while presenting more options for us to use. Based on the
            updated color scheme, I created a series of buttons that had a more modern look compared to the original
            circle buttons.

            Based on the ideation sessions and the changes made in the styleguide, I created a concept design for the
            updated website.

            Although this organization was an open-source nonprofit, it functioned like a remote startup and had an
            intense environment. This is where I first learned about participating in design sprints and completing
            tasks as tickets on Airtable. I wore many hats and picked up new skills as the situation called for while
            collaborating with other designers, researchers, and content writers. It was a positive experience overall,
            as it taught me to be proactive and take charge of different projects whenever I notice a problem with our
            product.
