        <h3 class="white-text small-spacing width">
            How do you design an app that educates students about healthy habits, but in a way that they want to
            actually use it?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <!-- ideation -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Ideation</h3>
        <p>I started by doing the
            <strong>User Research</strong> and <strong>Market Research</strong>
            to determine what we needed to do in order to create a successful product. It appeared that most people
            download EdTech apps but don't use it. Not only do we want to draw in new users, but we want to maintain
            user retention and engagement with our existing base.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            As part of the Design Team, we brainstormed several different ideas on how to structure the app. Ideally, we
            wanted to gamify the activities using the most popular apps I researched at the time, which included Candy
            Crush and Pokemon Go.
            Unfortunately, we were unable to create the app that we wanted due to external constraints, but we were able
            to decide on the following framework:
            <!-- ultimately decided on the following framework: users will start by choosing a section containing a topic
            they want to complete. After reading a short introduction teaching them about the basics surrounding the
            topic, they will be given three activities. They will choose one to complete, after which they will answer a
            reflection question. Once they finish that, they will earn a badge. -->
        </p>

        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Users will complete an activity in order to get a badge. Once users gain at least six badges, they will
            become a Champion, which gives them access to exclusive
            content. We want to rely on our partnership with the NFL to excite our users and encourage them to
            participate.

                Students under 13 need parental permission in order to have access to an app to avoid million dollar
                lawsuits. While the company used the services of PRIVO, an organization that specializes in children's
                online privacy protection laws, I completed a KidAware certificate to understand the basics of child
                privacy laws in the US and UK, which includes COPPA guidelines.

        <p>
            Based on the research and the concerns outlined in the user profiles, I created a user flow that walks
            through the process needed to ensure student privacy and safety:

    </div>
    <div class="grey-bg">

    <!-- iteration -->
    <div class="width spacing">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Iterations</h3>
        <p>
            I created the <strong>low-fidelity</strong> and <strong>mid-fidelity mockups</strong>
            for the app, as well as some <strong>concept designs</strong> on some of the features we want to implement.
            Because I was involved in the <strong>curriculum building</strong>, I was able to easily build it into the
            app framework. During this process, I led brainstorming sessions with other educators and team members to
            ensure we included quality educational content.

    <!-- design update -->
    <div class="width small-spacing-bottom">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Design Update</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with the Visual Designer to redesign the app. While I focused on the UX, he expanded the blue and
            green color scheme in order to include brighter colors and textures to make the app fun and engaging.
            Here is an example of the changes we made with the old design:

            product:

    <!-- results -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Results</h3>
        <p>
            The app was published <strong>Apple Play</strong> and <strong>Google Play</strong>
            for students to download and enjoyed a sharp increase in new user sign-ups. Classrooms in New Jersey
            implemented this app to teach nutrition and other healthy habits to their students. Future design changes
            plan to use NFL player images and incorporate special events such as the Superbowl to give our users
            incentive to return to the app and continue to use it.
