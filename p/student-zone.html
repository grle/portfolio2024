                The Student Zone App is backed by the NFL and the National Dairy Council through Fuel Up to Play 60, a
                national organization geared towards empowering students through youth wellness programs. The goal of
                the app is to teach students healthy habits in the following six categories: Food as Fuel, Play: 60,
                Leadership, Mind & Body, Planet, and Community. The old app was in need of a serious overhaul, and I
                helped with the designing, prototyping, and curriculum development.

        <h3 class="white-text small-spacing width">
            How do you design an app that educates students about healthy habits, but in a way that they want to
            actually use it?
        </h3>

    <!-- ideation -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Ideation</h3>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            As part of the Design Team, we brainstormed several different ideas on how to structure the app, and
            ultimately decided on the following framework: users will start by choosing a section containing a topic
            they want to complete. After reading a short introduction teaching them about the basics surrounding the
            topic, they will be given three activities. They will choose one to complete, after which they will answer a
            reflection question. Once they finish that, they will earn a badge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Once users gain at least six badges, they will become a Champion, which gives them access to exclusive
            content. I participated in the ideation sessions about the future direction that the Champions section
            can take. I also did the
            <strong>User Research</strong> and <strong>Market Research</strong>
            to determine how our successful our product would be.

                Students under 13 need parental permission in order to have access to an app to avoid lawsuits. While

                protection
                laws, I completed a KidAware certificate to understand the basics of child privacy laws in the US and
                UK,

            through the process needed to ensure student privacy and safety:

        <p>
            I created the <strong>low-fidelity</strong> and <strong>mid-fidelity mockups</strong>
            for the app, as well as some <strong>concept designs</strong> on some of the features we want to implement.
            Because I was involved in the <strong>curriculum building</strong>, I was able to easily build it into the
            app framework.

        <p>
            We used Buildfire to create this app and worked with developers to implement some of the more advanced
            features regarding student privacy. Here is an example of the changes we made with the old design:

        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">High Fidelity</h3>

            We created the high fidelity wireframes through the Buildfire app builder. I worked with the Graphic
            Designer, who created the visuals to pair the UX design of the Student Zone app.

    <!-- results -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Results</h3>
        <p>
            The app was published <strong>Apple Play</strong> and <strong>Google Play</strong>
            for students to download. Some classrooms in New Jersey implemented this app to teach nutrition and other
            healthy habits to the students. Future design changes plan to incorporate events such as the Superbowl and
            other NFL player images to boost engagement.
