        <h3 class="white-text small-spacing width">
            How do you teach online leadership skills to an older audience if they are not tech savvy?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <!-- user research -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">User Research</h3>
        <p><strong>What do we know about the users?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            Conversations with our client in ideation sessions show that their target audience includes older adults,
            mostly scientists and professors. Most users not only struggle with basic technological literacy but are
            unfamiliar with modern-day corporate language. In the product redesign, they were especially interested in
            making the course easier to use.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            These are some pain points our team identified based on the user survey and interviews from previous users:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>It’s time consuming.</strong> Previous learners report spending more time than anticipated
                watching lectures and working on assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>It’s convoluted.</strong> While users have positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the
                material, some have reported difficulty paying attention to the course because of how dense it is.</li>
            <li><strong>The product design is dated.</strong> This product relies on traditional classroom-based
                learning styles. These visuals of the course lacks a design system or typography hierarchy, meaning it
                falls behind their competitors’ more streamlined online courses.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- competitive analysis -->
    <div class="width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Our client wanted to continue using a traditional, classroom-based learning style in their product. This
            would include hour-long lectures, extensive assignments, and dense learning materials. They appeared
            reluctant to make too many changes from what they were familiar with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top small-spacing-bottom">
            However, we believed there was a better, easier way to create this product. To build our case, I started by
            researching successful EdTech companies and identifying the things they did that made them popular with
            their intended audience.
        </p>

            alt="image of logos: Udemy, Khan Academy, Coursera, EdX, and LinkedIn Learning">
    </div>
    <div class="small-spacing-top width">
        <p>Here are some of the qualities we identified for the <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li>Short lectures</li>
            <li>Activity tracking</li>
            <li>Check-in quizzes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- design strategy -->
    <div class="spacing width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Design Strategy</h3>
        <p>Here are the changes I suggested to the clients based on the comparative analysis:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>Break it down.</strong> Instead of watching an hour-long lecture in a single sitting, we break
                it into manageable chunks that are 5 minutes or less. This would be especially helpful for working
                professionals with an unpredictable schedule, as they do not need to commit to a large time block.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Track their progress.</strong> Users can check off items they completed, making it possible for
                them to be consistent about completing their work when they can see the progress they made.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reduce the cognitive load.</strong> Remove the intensive assignments so that users are less
                distracted by busywork. Instead, use brief check-ins to make sure the users are paying attention to the
                learning material.
            </li>
            <!-- <li><strong>Separate the assignments from the lecture.</strong> The current course integrates assignments to
                the lecture, meaning the video stops periodically and requires users to complete an activity in order to
                proceed. We should separate them into different sections.
            </li> -->
        </ul>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            We created a micro-module showcasing what it could look like to implement these changes. After we presented
            this to them, our client became excited by the new direction as well as the possibility of bringing new
            changes to this product.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- styleguide update -->
    <div class="width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Styleguide Update</h3>
        <p>
            The old styleguide was heavy on using dark green colors with a dark background while lacking a clear text
            hierarchy. There were a lot of different fonts and long clusters of text that made the material difficult to
            read, especially when most of them were in columns of different lengths.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top small-spacing-bottom">
            It was true that the visuals had a lot of room for improvement; however, my goal with the styleguide was to
            not only make the UI look better but to make it easier for people to use this product.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="text-padding-top">
            Here are some major design changes I used to make it more user friendly:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul small-spacing-bottom">
            <li>I cut down the text-heavy pages and PowerPoint, replacing them with a clean and minimalist style.</li>
            <li>I replaced the columns with horizontal text, which makes it more readable.</li>
            <li>I included emojis and other visual cues to indicate users the type of activity they will need to
                complete.</li>
            <li>I removed unnecessary visuals and added an easy-to-find transcript, which greatly improved
                accessibility.</li>
            <li>I created a clear text hierarchy so that users know what information to focus on.</li>
        </ul> -->

    <!-- lecture update -->
    <div class="spacing-top width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Lecture Update</h3>
        <p>
            The old videos were heavily cluttered, with large blocks of text and pictures crowding the screen. The
            person narrating the lectures was fixed in the bottom right-hand corner. At random intervals, the lecture
            would suddenly stop and notify the user that they needed to complete a time-consuming assignment. However,
            there was no way to confirm that the assignment was submitted before the user could proceed with the
            lecture. There was also no way to bookmark your progress on the lecture, so if you refreshed the page or
            logged out, you had to start from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top small-spacing-bottom">
            Using <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong>,
            I took the existing lectures and cut them into shorter lectures based on topics. I also edited the videos by
            shortening the text and animating it to appear line by line as the speaker mentions the topic.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="text-padding-top">I relied on the Competitive Analysis to create a new structure of each video:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul small-spacing-bottom">
            <li>I included a video thumbnail to give all of them a consistent appearance for the users.</li>
            <li>I started with a full shot of the speaker, who introduced the topic at hand.</li>
            <li>I created animations and included them with other visuals in place of texts, when appropriate.</li>
            <li>I shortened the pauses in the audio and removed background noises from some guest speakers on
                <strong>Adobe Audition</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>I separated the assignment and marked it required for submission to complete the module it was in.</li>
        </ul> -->

    <!-- information architecture update -->
    <div class="spacing-top width">
        <h3 class="small-spacing-bottom">Information Architecture Update</h3>
        <p>
            I made changes to the information architecture, reorganizing items in the product to make it more intuitive
            and easy to navigate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top">
            One example was how I created the <strong>Course Resources</strong> tab.
            Previously, there were many different paths to finding the Course Resources, all deeply embedded in
            different modules. Sometimes, it would show resources for one module, and other times it would show
            resources for all modules. It was confusing and inconsistent, taking around <strong>4 or 5 clicks</strong>
            from the home page to reach the final destination from multiple starting points.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding-top small-spacing-bottom">
            I changed this by putting all the resources into a single page, which users can access with just
            <strong>one click</strong> by placing the Course Resources as an option on the left-hand navigation. I also
            ordered the resources by phases and modules, making it easier to find visually. This was especially well
            received by the client, as they wanted users to maintain access to the resources after they left the
            program, so consolidating it simplified that process.
        </p>

    <div class="accent-bg">

        <p>100% of feedback regarding the changes have been positive:</p>
        <ul class="text-ul">
            <li><strong>Users</strong> have reported that this updated design is easy to use and navigate. Through
                feedback surveys, the client has reported an increase in positive responses.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholders</strong> were pleased with the results, and have praised the updated product for
                its minimalist design and simplicity.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Instructors</strong> have noted that the updates have helped their sessions run more smoothly

        <p class="text-padding-top">
            We are happy to see that our clients are happy. Of course, there is always room for improvement.
            There are already talks on what changes can be made for the next iteration, specifically about
            reshooting some of the lectures and updating the language used in the learning material.

                    I have learned a lot from this experience. I had to push myself to learn more about Adobe Creative
                    Cloud, as well as create animations to brighten up the learning experience. It was also the first
                    time I took charge of a project and presented it to the stakeholders while projecting confidence
                    about my work. It tested my communication skills, as well as my ability to explain design decisions
                    to the clients in a way they could understand and get behind.
